# RoyaltAI
## MGM Sales & Smart Rights App Tracker
 RoyaltAI ‚Äì Content Licensing & Royalty Management in Salesforce
## Overview
RoyaltAI is an intelligent Salesforce-based app that helps media companies like MGM or Amazon manage the full lifecycle of content licenses, contracts, and royalties.
It includes modern UI with Lightning Web Components (LWC), Apex logic, and AI-powered enhancements to answer questions like:
"Who owns streaming rights for Season 3 of XYZ show in Europe?"
All from one place ‚Äî no spreadsheets, no delays, no confusion.

## Why This Project?
Most media companies use 3‚Äì4 disconnected systems to manage licensing, royalties, and content ownership. That causes delays, confusion, and missed revenue.
RoyaltAI solves that with a single Salesforce solution that brings together:
Licensing rules,
Royalty calculations,
Contract validation,
Client & payment tracking,
In a real-time, low-maintenance, high-visibility app.

## üéØ Features
- Manage Content, Licenses, Clients, and Contracts,
- Automate Royalty tracking and payment calculations,
- Real-time insights with LWC dashboards,
- Smart Apex triggers & validations for business rules,
- Email alerts and validation errors for invalid data,
- AI chatbot integration for smart queries,
- Timeline views, charts, and performance metrics (LWC enhancements).

## Demo Use Case (Example)
Scenario: MGM Sales Agent wants to check "Who owns streaming rights for Season 3 of XYZ in Europe?"
## RoyaltAI
Instantly returns matching License + Contract record,
Shows start/end dates, client, territory,
Provides a direct contract link (PDF or record view)

## Impact
- Saves time and avoids confusion for licensing teams,
- Reduces risk of duplicate licenses or missed royalty payments,
- Delivers real-time insights into who owns what, where, and when,
- Builds a foundation for AI-driven media sales automation.
